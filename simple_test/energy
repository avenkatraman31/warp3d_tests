            elastic + plastic work of all active elements
            work of killed elements (cells, cohesive)

  plastic:  total of all plastic contributions to internal work
            plastic work of all active elements
            plastic work of killed elements (cells, cohesive)

  Note: internal energy is not correct for *large* elastic deformations computed with
        the hypoelastic material models (bilinear, mises, Gurson, ..).
        WARP3D uses the Green-Nagdhi stress-rate. Abaqus uses Jaumann rate. Both codes compute
        incorrect internal work for large elastic strains with hypoelastic material models.
         w/ v. small elastic strains.
