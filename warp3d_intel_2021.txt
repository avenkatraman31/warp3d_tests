Compiling WARP-3D with intel oneapi fortran compiler
**Tested with Intel Fortran Compiler Classic 2021.3.0 and mkl 2021.3.0 standalone
1. Download VS2019 first and install
2. Make sure to include Desktop C++ development components in Visual Studio install
3. Add location of nmake.exe and link.exe (usually same folder) within the VS installation to Path in system environment variables.
4. Download Intel Fortran Compiler and mkl and install. It will automatically recognize the presence of VS2019.
5. Add ifort.exe location and mkl_link_tool.exe to Path (mkl libraries may not automatically link to ifort; this might be redundant, but its a safety check)
6. Open Intel OneAPI command prompt for Intel 64 for Visual Studio (yep, that's the name) - in your start menu, else navigate to it C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\OneAPI\
7. Add the location of libraries needed to use nmake executable externally by typing in cmd:
set LIB="<IFortInstallDir>\compiler\lib\intel64_win";%LIB%  (adjust <IFortInstallDir> as needed)
8. Go to <Warp3DInstallDir>\src
9. Type Makewarp.bat 
10. Enjoy
