Compiling WARP-3D with intel oneapi fortran compiler
**Tested with Intel Fortran Compiler Classic 2021.3.0 and mkl 2021.3.0 standalone
1. Download VS2019 first and install
2. Make sure to include Desktop C++ development components in Visual Studio install
3. Add location of nmake.exe and link.exe (usually same folder) within the VS installation to Path in system environment variables. (make sure to ensure 32-bit/64-bit consistency with code)
4. Download Intel Fortran Compiler Classic 2021.3.0  and mkl 2021.3.0 (both standalone) and install. It will automatically recognize the presence of VS2019.
5. Add ifort.exe location and mkl_link_tool.exe to Path (mkl libraries may not automatically link to ifort; this might be redundant, but its better to do it anyways)
6. Open Intel OneAPI command prompt for Intel 64 for Visual Studio 2019(yep, that's the name) - in your start menu, else navigate to it C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\OneAPI\
7. Add the location of libraries that are needed to use nmake executable externally by typing the following in cmd:
set LIB="<IFortInstallDir>\compiler\lib\intel64_win";%LIB%  (adjust <IFortInstallDir> as needed)
8. Go to <Warp3DInstallDir>\src
9. Type Makewarp.bat 
10. Enjoy
Note: You may also use Intel oneAPI base toolkit 2021.3.0 that includes both fortran and mkl, but it includes various other components and is much larger.
